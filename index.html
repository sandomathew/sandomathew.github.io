                "Sando is a reliable problem solver with an attention to detail. While working with the team, he has been able to identify patterns through our ticketing data and sales data to come up with structured solutions which were used to manage contractors working in our support organization. He has strong people skills and is able to think outside of the box, able to look at things from different perspectives depending on his audience.

Most recently, Sando has helped to kick-start our machine learning initiative, using trends in our ticketing data to find when an excessive amount of tickets are coming in for any one category and helping to sort it out. This framework was designed to be scalable, allowing for the team to plug it into other application tickets and bring value back to our lines of business.

Sando also has strong leadership skills, not only being able to manage contractor resources, but also being able to bring data into a discussion to help drive a point. He was able to use this skill to identify top areas of opportunity on our support team and help direct the team to work them.

I would strongly recommend Sando for any role involving analyzing data to find actionable outcomes, creating intuitive dashboards for displaying said data, and motivating people through data."

He was always willing to show how he created his reports and teach others how to utilize them and add to them. Sando has a great work ethic and will be a strong addition for any team.

'counts' as well as filtering on error messages to find the biggest issues to focus on. He is a huge asset to the team. -Lissa <br> I wanted to call out Sando's contribution to the workday conversion team.
He has been of tremendous help and a big asset to the team. The tools he has built to refresh our mapping tables, loading our seed table has made it a lot easier for all of us.
He understands the basic requirements very well and has coded some of the complex payroll programs. His willingness to always help is much appreciated and it's great to have his skillsets on this team. - Ashraf"

                "I want to call out the effort Sando put forth insuring this project was delivered on time, within budget and satisfied all the requirements, in other words successful. Sando's role was Project Manager. He had to come up to speed quickly on the business requirements and technology. He successfully managed three RSAs that were instrumental in enabling and integrating the new SAE system with backend Chrysler systems and services. These RSAs were subject to the new SWIFT process and ever changing cloud architecture. As directed by executive management, the Azure cloud hosting changed back and forth between EMEA and NAFTA a couple of times that would stress the most seasoned Project Manager. The NAFTA cloud solution was finalized a month after the project schedule called for the infrastructure to be stood up. Sando with the project team was able to plan, re-plan & execute accordingly while still delivering on the original deadline. <br>
Sando will be moving on shortly to a new assignment within TCS. He will surely be a major contributor within his new team and assignment - we wish him the best !!!"
